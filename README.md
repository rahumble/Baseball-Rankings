# Baseball Valuations

This code forms the basis for player valuations for a one-week roto-style fantasy baseball draft.

The excel sheets house data about player predictions (assumed true and given), try to value players, and track the draft as it happens.

The python code tries to determine the values of the players iteratively by simulating thousands of games.
